# Project Purpose
Meta-Repository Workshop (JavaZone 2025): a Jekyll-based workshop site plus instructor/developer materials for teaching the "meta-repo" technique (using the npm `meta` tool) as a lightweight alternative to monorepos. Provides:
- Public participant-facing site (GitHub Pages) with agenda, prerequisites, tasks.
- Slides (Reveal.js) for presentation.
- Hands-on exercises under `workshop/` with stepwise tasks & solutions.
- Instructor & spec docs (INSTRUCTOR.md, DEVELOP.md, WORKSHOP-SPEC.md) for preparation & delivery.
Deployment via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages; local dev via Docker or Bundler.
Primary goal: enable attendees to learn setting up and leveraging meta-repo tooling across multiple git repositories (automation, cross-repo ops, analysis, templates).

# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deploy Fix

## Problem
When we removed `.nojekyll` and switched to Jekyll, GitHub Pages tried to build our site with its limited Jekyll environment. The `jekyll-spaceship` plugin isn't supported by GitHub Pages' default Jekyll builder.

## Solution: GitHub Actions
Created `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml` that builds Jekyll with our full plugin set and deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Required GitHub Settings Change

⚠️ **Important**: You need to change GitHub Pages source to use GitHub Actions:

1. Go to your repo: https://github.com/kjetiljd/meta-repo-workshop
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in left sidebar  
4. Under **Source**, change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Save settings

## What the GitHub Action does

```yaml
├── Checkout code
├── Setup Ruby 3.2
├── Bundle install (with caching)
├── Build Jekyll with production settings
└── Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Benefits

✅ **Full plugin support** - Can use jekyll-spaceship and any gems  
✅ **Production builds** - Proper JEKYLL_ENV=production  
✅ **Automatic caching** - Faster builds with Ruby gem caching  
✅ **Manual triggers** - Can trigger builds from Actions tab

## Commit commands

```bash
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for Jekyll deployment

- Fix GitHub Pages deployment by using GitHub Actions
- Support all Jekyll plugins including jekyll-spaceship  
- Add production build environment
- Enable manual workflow dispatch"

git push origin main
```

After pushing, the Action will trigger automatically. Check the **Actions** tab to see build progress.

## Verification

1. Push the changes ↑
2. Change GitHub Pages source to "GitHub Actions" in Settings
3. Wait for Action to complete (~2-3 minutes)
4. Visit: https://kjetiljd.github.io/meta-repo-workshop/

**GitHub Actions will now handle Jekyll building and deployment! 🚀**
